# Welcome to Skoods

Skoods is a Self-Racing Car Team, crowdsourced, running virtual competitions in our platform. We build simulation scenarios and models for self-driving cars as racing competitions. Our community of pilots develops algorithms on our platform: learning, interacting and competing for awards and market recognition.





We deliver competitive engineering technologies and talents to the autonomous vehicles industry.

Our mission is to have a real Self-Racing Car by 2020.



Skoods develops virtual simulation scenarios and models for self-driving cars as racing competitions and the racing teams generate autonomous vehicles algorithms to win the prize.



Our secret sauce is our community of 216 engineers and developers, from 5 continents, competing and collaborating in our platform.
